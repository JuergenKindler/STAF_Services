Just a small repository containing experiments about creating services to be plugged into STAF.

The current contents demonstrate how to
- simplify service implementation by providing common code (common, irc_impl)
- include dependencies for building / packaging staf services (irc_service)

Not started:
- helpers for simpler creation of request parsers
- real working implementation of irc functions (irc_impl)
