Just a small repository containing experiments about creating services to be plugged into STAF.

JMX service
===========
- can find all running JVMs on the machine where the service runs connect locally
- can list all MBeans, their attributes and operations of a JVM
- can query attributes & operations
- for now calling methods is not yet supported
